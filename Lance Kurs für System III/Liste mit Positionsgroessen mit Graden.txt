One thing I get asked over and over is Lance I understand the need for exponential bet sizing my trading, but how do I actually get myself to push my size?

One trick I would use to help me push sizing was this simple note card that was taped to my desk.

The only thing this note card had on.

It was a list of setup grades and the respective exponential bet size amounts of i.

Wanted to aim for this had two huge benefits.

One it would force me to constantly grade my trades before entry and during live positions and two it.

Removed all discretion and simplified my processing essentially freeing up my mental RAM to focus on other nuances to the trade.

Anytime you can think about one less variable, the quicker your thinking becomes at the end of the day.

This is just a tool to become conscious of your sizing in real time and don't get.

Me wrong.

This is much easier said than done, but with enough practice and time you'll get there you can gradually and safely move toWards an optimal bet shape and size at your own pace.

It's going to be a very cool process when you start to experiment with this and you start to build that consciousness Using this tool is going to facilitate a way for you to ramp up sizing for the rest.

Of your career.

When sizing was my daily report card goal I aimed to increase my risk by roughly ten percent each month.

Doing that gradually doubled my size over the course of seven months.

Think about how following a simple note card can make pushing size so much easier.

So find what's right for you, but always make gradual changes as great as this technique is for growing your trading account.

There's little hope to do that.

If you're not properly assessing the probability of your trades working out once you have a deep understanding of that.

All it takes is a note card to help, keep it at the forefront of your mind and tie the two together.

Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best ones.
