In the upcoming series of videos.

You're going to learn what an incredibly versatile tool moving averages are.

I use them in a ton of ways and I'd imagine there are even more ways to utilize them that I haven't yet discovered when applied to in place stocks.

Moving averages can often be very powerful, unlike how they are utilized in the Ridiculouslyisticistic Academic Studies that.

Tend to not find efficacy in them as a trader who prefers a few simple indicators over having a chart that is painted with them.

The main chart indicator I use is the Bollinger bands.

Bollinger bands at their default setting include bands that are two standard deviations away from a middle line which defaults as a twenty period simple moving average.

Essentially that middle line is the average closing price over the last twenty periods.

So for my two minute bar intraday chart it is the average closing price over the last forty minutes and for my daily chart it is the average closing price over last twenty days.

I use that simple moving average in many ways, depending on the context of the chart.

For stocks that are capitulating, I use moving averages to gauge over extension as well as one of the indicators of potential reward should a bounce occur.

I also use moving averages to gauge a proper consolidation length.

Finally, moving averages can even become support or resistance.

In the following videos.

I'm going to discuss all of the ways.

I employ moving averages to accomplish those objectives, explain why I think they work as well as include case studies that represent practical examples of these tools.

Incorrect you're a trend follower or a mean version trader, incorporating moving averages into your trading toolbox can enhance your ability to navigate the markets and achieve trading successfully.
