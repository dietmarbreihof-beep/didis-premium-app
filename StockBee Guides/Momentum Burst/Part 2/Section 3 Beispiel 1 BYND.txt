So in order to understand this particular setup well and trade it well, you need to go through lot more examples of tooling so that in real time when you are running a scan, you can instantly recognize this particular setup very easily.

And in order to do that, you need to study as many examples as possible of things which have happened in the past.

What I'm going to show you is a couple of setups are like in this particular video.

I'm going to show you one setup example, which will show you what to look for in a good tool.

In setup for that let me go to my TC two thousand and show it.

To you if you go.

And look at this.

On this particular day you had the first leg, so the stock is not up two days in a.

Row, right?

It has a narrower negative day that's the narrower negative day prior to breakout.

Stock is closing near high.

It has linearity, it has persistent buying in the first leg of the move, so it meets all year to linge condition.

There is no four percent breakdown doesn't have anything.

And that is the kind of a setup.

If you really focus on these kind of setups only then what you'll see is that this kind of setups work very well.

If you select a very choppy setup, set up up three days in a row, it's not going to work.

So this is The kind of two link setup on the breakout day.

Example you want to see if you can find setups like this only in a year, then you are going to have much greater probability of success.

Everything which you look for in Tulip Not Up Two Days in a.

Row.

Linearity, linearity is here, even the consolidation is very orderly right narrow or negative day prior to the breakout, narrow or negative day prior to the breakout.

Consolidation quality very orderly, compact consolidation just of four days.

No big volume during the consolidation.

There is no four percent breakdown during the consolidation.

Stock is breaking out, closing near the high, so it meets every single condition in two linge.
