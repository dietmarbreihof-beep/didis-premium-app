Summary of EG’s Landmark Session “Strategy & Structure – The Only Thing That Separates 20-Year Winners from Eternal Losers”
Eg declares that 98–99 % of traders (including most who have been trading 5–10+ years) are permanently stuck in a hopeless loop because they have never defined a real Strategy and the Structure that must flow from it.

Everything else (scans, indicators, entries, stops, 80 % off software, “free alerts”, 10 000-hour screen time) is completely meaningless noise without these two foundational pieces.

The Complete Hierarchy (EG’s exact framework)
STRATEGY → Lifelong philosophy (changes once a decade or never)
STRUCTURE → The permanent market environments, stock types, and setups you will trade
PROCESS → How you find and manage trades (can evolve)
EXECUTION → Exact entries, stops, software, etc. (constantly tweaked, least important)
98 % of traders live 100 % in layers 3 & 4 while layers 1 & 2 don’t exist.

EG’s Personal Strategy & Structure (unchanged for decades)
STRATEGY (two sentences he can say in his sleep)

“Trade only for MAGNITUDE, never for duration.

Combine singles (8–40 % momentum bursts) with home runs (50–300 %+ EPs) so the singles finance the home runs and keep drawdowns survivable.”

STRUCTURE (everything below is 100 % dictated by the strategy above)

Stock universe 39–100 %+ sales-growth monsters or explosive catalysts only
Setups EP 9-million, Sugar Babies, Delayed-Reaction EPs, momentum bursts
Zero interest in 200-day MAs, yearly persistency, slow grinds, turnarounds without velocity, etc.
Market timing is mandatory (only trade when magnitude environments dominate)
